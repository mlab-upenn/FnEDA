\chapter{Closed-loop Model Simulation and Testing}
Model checking is performed on abstract models of the system, which is the first step during the development process. The verified system model during model checking is translated into Stateflow model, which is a step towards the code implementation. Closed-loop simulation/testing are performed on more refined model or the actual system thus can complement model checking in terms of resolving ambiguities within abstract counterexamples. We aim to answer the following questions here:

\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-5pt}
	\item How are abstract models translated to deterministic models for simulation-based testing?
	\vspace{-5pt}
	\item What system level issues are best tested at the platform level?
\end{itemize}

In this chapter, we first describe an approach to automatically translate formal models that are verified in UPPAAL to Stateflow charts for simulation-based testing, and then code generated to run on an embedded platform. Following this, we demonstrate two examples that cannot be explicitly modeled using abstract semantics and must be tested.

\section{UPPAAL to Stateflow Automated Model Translation}
Consider an UPPAAL model with automata $P_1,...,P_n$. We have developed a tool, UPP2SF (\cite{TECS}), to translate UPPAAL models Stateflow (see \figref{method}). In this case, UPP2SF produces to a two-level Stateflow chart as in \figref{chart}, with parallel states $P_1,...,P_n$ (referred to as the \textit{parent} states) derived from the automata, parallel states $Gc\_{x_1},..., Gc\_{x_m}$ (referred to as \textit{clock states}) that model all global clocks $x_1,...,x_m$ from the UPPAAL model, and the state $Eng$ that is used as the chart's control execution engine.
In addition, the chart has predefined global data variables (and constants) with appropriate variable ranges and initial values obtained from the UPPAAL model. 
Since all automata in UPPAAL are simultaneously active, the obtained Stateflow chart is a collection of parallel states with unique execution orders. Also, in every UPPAAL automaton exactly one location is active at a time. Thus, each of the parent states is a collection of exclusive states, extracted from locations in the UPPAAL automaton. In \cite{TECS}, we have shown that for a large class of UPPAAL models, UPP2SF preserves behavior of the initial UPPAAL model. We have also shown how the translation tool provides a way to estimate WCET during modeling and verification stage in UPPAAL, and facilitates development of modular code from UPPAAL timed-automata based models.

\label{fig:PM_sf}
\end{figure*}

We generated C code from the pacemaker Stateflow chart using the Simulink Coder. The code structure is shown in \figref{pm_code}.
The code was generated for the general embedded real-time target and as a result we obtained the main procedure, \texttt{rt\_OneStep}, which processes the three input events, $VinB$, $AinB$ and $clk$. To ensure that the model semantics is preserved (modulo the execution time), $clk$ input events should be created every 1ms, followed by the procedure's activation. This makes it suitable for implementation on top of a real-time operating system (RTOS).

The pacemaker code generated by the Simulink Real-Time Workshop's Embedded Coder was executed on nanoRK (\cite{nanork}), a fixed-priority preemptive RTOS that runs on a variety of resource constrained platforms. We tested the implementation on the TI MSP-EXP430F5438 Experimenter Board interfaced with a signal generator that provides inputs for the pacemaker code (\figref{setup}). More details regarding UPP2SF translation and platform testing can be found in \cite{TECS}.

\section{Pacemaker Oversensing and Crosstalk}
Oversensing is a general term for inappropriate sensing caused by noise or far-field signals. It's very common among pacemaker malfunctions and it may result in failure to pace (\cite{med2, leads}), competitive pacing and inappropriate therapy. Crosstalk is a special case for oversensing which occurs when the pacemaker stimulus in one chamber is sensed in the other chamber. It happens when two leads are close to each other or pacing signal in the other chamber is too strong. It is common that the ventricular lead is placed in the right ventricle outflow tract, which is close to the atrium (\cite{icd}). \figref{crosstalk}(a) shows simulated EGMs from a patient with bradycardia and complete heart block. During atrial pacing (AP), the pacing signal is sensed by the ventricular lead 53 ms after the AP. (Marker 1) It is treated as ventricular sense (VS) signal and thus inhibits the subsequent ventricular pacing (VP). This is indicated by no QRS-wave in the ECG channel. (Marker 2) For a patient with complete heart block this will cause dangerous ventricular asystole, meaning a long time without ventricular events.  

Increasing the sensing threshold of the ventricular channel can prevent false sensing. In \figref{crosstalk}(b), the small signals in ventricular EGM are ignored and ventricular pacing are successfully delivered.

\section{Lead Displacement}
Lead displacement affects many patients and can result in inappropriate or ineffective therapy. \figref{dislodge_norm} shows the simulation result for the pacemaker function when the leads are in their designated location. From the figure we can observe: 1) Each P-wave is initialized by an Atrial Pace signal. 2) Each QRS complex is initiated by a ventricular pacing signal. 3) The interval between AP and VP is 150 ms, which matches the programed AVI period.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One common case for lead dislodge is shown in \figref{race_cond}, where the atrial lead has fallen into the right ventricle outflow tract. In this case the atrial lead senses from the ventricle rather than atrium and atrial pacing will initiate a ventricular event. \figref{dislodge} shows the simulated EGMs in this case. The figure reveals several facts: 1) No P wave is sensed or tracked (Marker 1). 2) Atrial Pace initiates an abnormal, wide QRS which is then sensed by the ventricle lead (Marker 2). 3) Intermittent appearance of VP on QRS 110 ms after the AP. The ventricular lead can receive signal from: 1) pacing signal sent from the atrial lead, 2) the intrinsic A-V conduction path. The two path are shown in \figref{race_cond} and form a timing race condition. When the signal from the atrial lead arrives the ventricular lead first, it will trigger VS. If the intrinsic signal arrives the ventricular lead during the VSP sensing window (defined in previous section), it will trigger VSP. Although the pacing is 'safe' because the pacing is early enough to avoid the vulnerable refractory period, the damage caused by pacing on depolarized tissue is currently a matter of much investigation. 
\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we first introduced a mathematical translation method from UPPAAL timed automata model to Stateflow chart. Combined with Simulink coder, the tool chain provides rigorous evidence of traceability from physiological requirements to the C code implementation. Oversensing, crosstalk and lead displacement are three examples in which the cause of the problem is not modeled in the abstract interface in the timed-automata model. In such cases, closed-loop testing with the more refined heart models and EGM interface can be used to provide safety evidence.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
Closed-loop medical devices like implantable cardiac devices have both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities and interact with the patient autonomously in closed-loop. Their autonomy makes them the highest risk devices which requires the most stringent regulation. Currently clinical trials are the only mean to identify risks associated with the closed-loop interaction between the devices and the patient, which are both expensive and ineffective. Model-based design can potentially enable closed-loop evaluation earlier in the design process, which requires validated physiological models that can represent the closed-loop interaction of different physiological conditions. In this work, we use implantable pacemaker as example to demonstrate the application of model-based design in providing safety and effectiveness evidence of the device and how these activities fit into the regulation process. We developed heart models that capture the behaviors of various heart conditions, and tailored the heart models for closed-loop model checking and closed-loop testing, which have different requirements. In closed-loop model checking, an abstract model of the pacemaker was verified against physiological requirements. We identified the need for heart models at different abstraction level and demonstrated an automated approach to select the most appropriate heart model for specific requirements. The abstract model of the pacemaker was then translated to Stateflow chart using a mathematical procedure and then generated into C code implementation. In closed-loop testing, we use more refined heart models to capture mechanisms that were not captured in the abstract heart models and evaluated pacemaker algorithms. 

%As implantable medical devices grow in sophistication with significant capabilities implemented in software, firmware bugs account for an increasing fraction of device recalls. Since the FDA  does not test, verify or certify the software in such devices, there is an urgent need for a systematic methodology to guarantee the safety of the device software. Furthermore, this safety must account for the closed-loop interaction with the organs of interest. In this effort, we have presented a first step in the direction of a holistic approach for model-based testing and physical patient--device interactive validation. We achieve this through the design of an integrated functional and formal model of the heart and pacemaker device using timed automata. Using this closed-loop system, we conducted formal verification and translate the models to Stateflow for simulation-based testing and then automatically generate code from the verified models. We investigated basic operations, complex algorithms such as response to Pacemaker Mediated Tachycardia and platform-based testing of physical issues such as crosstalk and lead displacement. 

%To validate the environment model, we described an Abstraction Tree approach to select the heart model most appropriate for the specific requirement. This approach separated the evaluation phases where domain knowledge was necessary and where it was not, which simplified the verification of the medical device across a range of heart conditions. The model-based design toolchain from verified models to verified code is conducted within the clinically-relevant context and captures the complexities of interaction with physiological components. 

%This effort describes early steps toward cyber-physical model based testing, validation and verification of medical cyber-physical systems. This is a challenging domain as patient modeling is both complex, highly variable and non-deterministic and the safety properties must include over-approximated models for verification, abstract models for simulation and be realizable in physical form for testing. We aim to extend the current efforts to evaluate more complex devices such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) which are rate-adaptive and operate with varying levels of hysteresis. 

Eventually we aim to conduct model-based clinical trials with automated approaches to program and tune patient-specific electrophysiological heart models using data acquired from ablation procedures. By applying parametric and sensitivity analysis to a small sampling of real patient heart models, across a select set of cardiac conditions, to derive a physiologically relevant population of patient models. This allows us to explore a wider range of heart behaviors and expose more corner cases to isolate software safety issues prior to an actual clinical trial. Using certified heart models, a model-based clinical trial provides additional confidence in the closed-loop safety and efficacy of medical devices prior to expensive clinical-trials which are prone to failure.

%%\section{Current Practice}
%%%In United States, medical devices have to be approved by FDA to be released into the market. 
%%According to their potential risks the devices are categorized into 3 classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, corresponding to low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk devices \cite{class}. Life-sustaining devices like implantable pacemakers are classified as Class III and in general are subject to the most strict regulations.
%%
%%There are two processes that a medical device can enter the market in U.S.: the Premarket Notification, also known as 510(k) \cite{510k}, and the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) \cite{PMA}. In a 510(k) submission the device manufacturers are only required to provide evidence that the device is \emph{substantial equivalent} to a \emph{predicate device}, which has been approved for the market. Therefore, the 510(k) submission does not directly require clinical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of the device, thus is suitable for mostly low-risk devices like Class I and Class II devices.  The Pre-Market Approval (PMA) submission is a more stringent regulatory process in which direct clinical evidence is required to prove the safety and effectiveness of the device. However, not all Class III devices are subject to PMA submission. If a Class III device clears the 510(k) process and FDA has not requested PMA for that device, the device is still cleared for market release. A study shows that for Class III devices which PMA has been requested, the levels of evidence varies. Only 40\% of the PMA submissions are supported by controlled clinical trials, which provide the most rigorous clinical evidence \cite{cert_prob}. The lack of quality evidence is usually due to the high cost of the controlled clinical trials.
